### timer
a simple timer, uses python and applescript to play and pause Spotify
after a user specified amount of time. Currently run from the command line with 
invocation (where timer is an alias for "python /path/to/timer.py")

> $timer <num-minutes>

It will print out the number of minutes that are left in the specified time, 
pause Spotify at the end, and then show a popup notification and announce that 
the specified time is over. Used for time on task calculations.
